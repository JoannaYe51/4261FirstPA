# First Programming Assignment
A small application with backend implementation - Guess the Flag
## Overview
The "Guess The Flag" app is an interactive game designed to enhance users' knowledge of world flags. Built with SwiftUI, it offers a visually engaging interface where players guess the correct flag out of a selection presented on the screen.

## Features
- **Learning Through Play**: Players learn to recognize different national flags.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Tap on the flag you believe is correct and receive instant feedback.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your correct guesses and aim to improve your score.
- **End-Game Alert**: After a set number of rounds, players are prompted to restart the game or save their score.
- **Score Saving**: Option to save the game score to a backend server, allowing for history tracking.
- **Visual Effects**: Flags and UI elements include animations and visual effects for a dynamic user experience.

## Technical Details
- **SwiftUI for UI Design**: Utilizes SwiftUI for building the user interface, making it responsive and visually appealing.
- **Backend Integration**: Connects to a backend server for saving and retrieving score history.
- **Animation and State Management**: Implements state management and animations for interactive elements.

This app not only serves as an educational tool for learning about world flags but also demonstrates the integration of backend services with a SwiftUI application, showcasing state management, network requests, and user interaction handling.
